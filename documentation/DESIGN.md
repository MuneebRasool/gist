## 1. The Big Picture

GIST is a comprehensive task management system designed to function as an extension of users' organizational capabilities. The system goes beyond traditional task management by implementing intelligent prioritization, context awareness, and adaptive learning.

### Key Differentiators
- **Intelligent Task Extraction**: Automatically identifies tasks from users' digital communications
- **Context-Aware Prioritization**: Prioritizes tasks based on user-specific contexts
- **Adaptive Learning**: Improves performance through continuous usage
- **Scalable Architecture**: Supports individual users and enterprise teams

### Technical Foundation

### Core System Goals
1. **Dynamic Information Surfacing**: Surface relevant and actionable information while minimizing cognitive load
2. **Multi-Agent Coordination**: Orchestrate specialized agents that perform tasks and analyses on behalf of the user

### Core Principles

1. **Information as a Graph**
   - Maintain a weighted, real-time graph G(t) instead of static hierarchies
   - Nodes represent tasks, information, and agents
   - Edges capture relationships and dependencies
   - Weights reflect current relevance and strength of connections

2. **Dynamic Relevance Scoring**
   - For each node i at time t, calculate relevance score:
     ```math
     R_i(t) = α·U_i(t) - β·C_i(t)
     ```
   - Where:
     - R_i(t): Overall relevance score
     - U_i(t): Utility factor (importance/urgency)
     - C_i(t): Cognitive cost factor
     - α, β: Learning-adjusted scaling parameters

3. **Temporal Adaptation**
   - Continuously adjust relevance scores based on:
     - Current context
     - User feedback
     - Time-based decay
   - Update edge weights to reflect changing relationships

4. **Task Dependency Management**
   - Represent task dependencies as a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG)
   - Capture prerequisites and constraints
   - Enable optimal task sequencing

5. **Multi-Agent Coordination**
   - Distribute tasks to specialized agents using confidence scoring:
     ```math
     P(A_k|T_i^r)
     ```
   - Where:
     - A_k: Agent k
     - T_i^r: Task i with requirements r
     - P(): Probability of successful completion

6. **User-Centric Feedback Loop**
   - Learn from user actions and overrides
   - Continuously update system weights and parameters
   - Adapt to user preferences and patterns

### Task Model

Each task T_i in the system is modeled as an entity with:

1. **Dynamic Relevance**: R_i(t) that evolves with time
2. **Dependencies**: D(T_i, T_j) capturing task relationships
3. **Activation Threshold**: A_i determining when a task becomes actionable

The core relevance formula:

```math
R_i(t) = α·U_i(t) - β·C_i(t)
```

Where:
- U_i(t): Utility factor - measures importance and urgency
- C_i(t): Cognitive cost - estimates required mental effort
- α, β: System-learned scaling factors that adapt to user behavior

Task management is implemented as a mathematical system. Each task in the system is represented as a point in a network, with dynamic properties:

1. A dynamic relevance score R_i(t) that changes over time
2. A dependency system D(T_i, T_j) that establishes task prerequisites
3. An activation threshold A_i that determines when a task becomes actionable

The relevance formula is:

```math
R_i(t) = α·U_i(t) - β·C_i(t)
```

Where:
- U_i(t): The utility factor (importance/urgency)
- C_i(t): The cognitive cost (mental effort required)
- α, β: Scaling factors that adapt to user behavior
