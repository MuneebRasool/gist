# Langfuse for LLM Monitoring and Observability

## Overview
We use Langfuse as our primary tool for tracing, observing, and monitoring LLM API calls in our applications. Langfuse provides comprehensive visibility into our AI operations, helping us track performance, costs, and usage patterns.

## Models Being Monitored
We primarily monitor API calls to:
- **GPT-4o**: Our high-performance model for complex tasks
- **GPT-4o-mini**: Our cost-effective model for routine tasks

## Deployment Options

### Self-Hosted (Open Source)
- Langfuse is available as an open-source solution
- Can be deployed on your own infrastructure
- Provides full control over data and configuration
- Suitable for enterprise needs or teams with specific compliance requirements

### Cloud Version
- Managed solution with minimal setup
- Ideal for individual developers or small teams
- Quick to implement with no infrastructure management
- Pay-as-you-go pricing model

## Cost Analysis

### Onboarding Process
- **Average Cost**: $0.50 per user onboarding
- This includes all LLM API calls needed to process and set up a new user
- Costs are consistent and predictable for this workflow

### Ongoing Usage
- Post-onboarding costs vary based on user activity
- Primary cost driver: **Number of emails processed** per user
- Higher email volume correlates directly with increased API calls
- Cost fluctuations align with user engagement patterns

## Implementation Benefits
- **Real-time monitoring** of API calls and response times
- **Cost tracking** at granular levels (per user, per feature)
- **Performance analytics** to identify optimization opportunities
- **Error detection** for failed or problematic API calls

## Best Practices
- Set up alerts for unusual cost spikes
- Establish baselines for expected API usage
- Regularly review performance metrics to identify optimization opportunities
- Use tracing to debug complex workflows
- Track token usage to manage costs effectively

## Getting Started
To implement Langfuse in your application:
1. Install the Langfuse SDK
2. Configure API keys and endpoints
3. Instrument your code with trace points
4. Set up a dashboard for monitoring

## Conclusion
Langfuse provides essential visibility into our LLM operations, helping us maintain reliable performance while managing costs effectively. The predictable onboarding costs and variable ongoing usage create a scalable monitoring solution for our AI-powered features.
