Configuring the Nylas Webhook
This guide explains how to properly set up and configure a Nylas webhook to receive notifications when new events are created.
Step-by-Step Configuration
1. Access the Nylas Dashboard

Log in to your Nylas developer account
Navigate to the dashboard for your application

2. Configure Webhook Settings

Go to the Notifications section in the left sidebar
Select the option to Create Webhook
Enter your server's webhook endpoint URL (e.g., https://your-domain.com/api/agent/webhook)
Set the trigger to event.created to receive notifications when new calendar events are created

3. Local Development Setup
If you're developing locally, Nylas will need a publicly accessible URL to send webhook notifications. You have two options:
Option A: Using ngrok
bash# Install ngrok if you haven't already
npm install -g ngrok

# Forward your local server port (e.g., 3000)
ngrok http 3000
Then use the generated ngrok URL (e.g., https://a1b2c3d4.ngrok.io/api/agent/webhook) as your webhook endpoint.
Option B: Using VS Code port forwarding

Open the "Ports" panel in VS Code (usually found in the bottom panel)
Click the "Forward a Port" button
Enter your local server port (e.g., 8000)
Use the generated URL as your webhook endpoint

5. Testing Your Webhook

send an email to the registered email.
Check your server logs to confirm the webhook notification is received
Debug any connection issues if notifications aren't coming through

Security Considerations

Consider implementing webhook signature verification to ensure requests come from Nylas
Use environment variables to store any sensitive information
Set up proper error handling for your webhook endpoint

Troubleshooting

Ensure your firewall settings allow incoming webhook connections
Verify the webhook URL is correctly entered in the Nylas dashboard
Check that your server is properly handling POST requests to the webhook endpoint
Confirm your ngrok or port forwarding session is active and hasn't expired
