# Why We Built Gist

## The Problem

Today, managing information is harder than ever.
We face:

* 100+ emails daily
* Constant notifications
* Too many apps needing attention
* Frequent switching between tasks

These overload us. Instead of helping, tools often make things worse.
Email mixes urgent and unimportant messages.
Social media distracts.
Task lists keep growing without progress.

## The Challenge

Many tools:

* Add more information, not clarity
* Care more about clicks than value
* Pull attention in many directions

This causes:

* Endless notifications
* Feeds designed to keep you scrolling
* Professional networks that create pressure
* Wasted time sorting through messages

We’re drowning in information that our minds can’t keep up with.

## Our Solution: Gist

We built Gist to solve this.
It’s based on two ideas:

### 1. Show info at the right time

Gist doesn’t show everything at once.
It gives you what you need, when you need it.
Less urgent things can wait.

### 2. Balance focus

Gist protects your focus.
It holds back tasks that would interrupt.
It surfaces tasks that fit your current work.

## Why It Matters

Gist isn’t just another tool.
It’s a new way to work with information—
helping your brain, not fighting it.

It’s for:

* Professionals overwhelmed by info
* Knowledge workers needing clarity
* Anyone wanting tools that support focus, not distractions
