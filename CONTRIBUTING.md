We're thrilled you're interested in contributing to GIST. Whether you're fixing a bug, adding a feature, or improving our docs, every contribution makes GIST better! To keep our community vibrant and welcoming, all members must adhere to our Code of Conduct.

## Setting Up Locally

There are two ways to set up GIST locally:

### Quick Setup

Use our automated setup script:

This script will set up the project with lightning speed, installing all dependencies and configuring your environment.

### Manual Setup

If you prefer setting up manually:

1. **Frontend (Web)**
   ```bash
   pnpm install
   pnpm dev
   ```

2. **Backend (Server)**
   ```bash
   uv venv
   source .venv/bin/activate
   uv sync
   fastapi dev
   ```

### Environment Variables

All required environment variables are documented in [Documentation/environment-variables.md](Documentation/environment-variables.md). Make sure to set these up before running the project.
