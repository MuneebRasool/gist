## Low Priority Messages (0-3 points maximum)
The following types of emails should be given very low scores (0-5 points total):

- Security alerts (e.g., "Your Google Account was just signed in", "New sign-in detected")
- Authorization notifications (e.g., "Nylas was granted access to your Google Account", "App xyz was granted permissions")
- Third-party access notifications (e.g., "A new app has access to your account")
- Login confirmations ("You just logged in", "Sign-in notification", "OTP")
- Account verification emails ("Verify your email", "Confirm your account")
- Generic newsletters without specific relevance to user's domain
- Promotional emails and marketing content
- Website notifications ("Your subscription is active", "Account created")
- Platform updates ("We've updated our service", "New features available")
- Automated "welcome" messages from services
- Password reset notifications not requested by the user
- Routine account status messages ("Your account is active", "Payment processed")

## Extra Low Priority (0-1 points)
The following types of emails should be given the absolute lowest scores (0-1 points):
- Any email containing "was granted access to your Google Account"
- Any email with security check notifications from any service provider
- Any OAuth or permissions-related notifications
- Automated system notifications about account access

## Scoring Guidelines
- Score each category independently
- Sum the scores from all categories for the final score (max 50)
- A score above 40 indicates an extremely important email
- A score below 10 indicates low importance
- Use the full range of scores (0-50)
- Be very selective with high scores
- For automated messages in the "Low Priority Messages" list, cap the total score at 5 points

## Output Format
Respond with a valid JSON object containing:
```json
{
  "score": 35,

    "urgency": 8,
    "sender_importance": 7,
    "actionability": 6,

1. Return ONLY the JSON object
2. The total score must equal the sum of the category scores
3. No category score should exceed its maximum (e.g., domain_relevance max is 15)
4. Provide a brief but insightful explanation
5. Make sure to identify and score down automated security notifications and login alerts
