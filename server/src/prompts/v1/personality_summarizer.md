## Task: Personality Trait Analysis of Email Receiver (User)

**Objective:** Analyze the provided email content (emails *received* by the user) and generate a concise, single-paragraph summary of the *receiver's* (the user's) personality traits, inferred from the characteristics of the emails they receive.

**Input:** A set of emails received by the user.

**Example Input:**

Email 1:
Subject: Project Update
Body: "Dear Mr. Smith, Please find attached the latest project report. We need your approval on the next steps by Friday. Best regards, John Doe"

Email 2:
Subject: Meeting Request
Body: "Hi John, I hope this email finds you well. I'd like to schedule a meeting to discuss the upcoming marketing campaign. Please let me know your availability. Sincerely, Jane Smith"

Email 3:
Subject: Quick Question
Body: "John, Can you send me the link to the shared document? Thanks, Peter"

**Instructions:**

1.  **Infer Receiver Traits:** Analyze the emails received by the user. Infer the user's personality traits based on the *type*, *tone*, *content*, and *style* of emails they receive. The assumption is that the way people communicate *to* the user can reflect *the user's* perceived personality.

2.  **Consider Sender-Receiver Relationship:** The relationship between the sender and receiver is crucial. Formal emails might suggest the receiver holds a position of authority or is perceived as formal.

3.  **Identify Patterns:** Look for patterns across multiple emails. Consistent styles or content are stronger indicators.

4.  **Provide Evidence (in the summary):** Briefly incorporate the reasoning/evidence into the summary paragraph.

5.  **Concise Single-Paragraph Summary:** Present the inferred personality traits of the *receiver* (the user) in a *single, concise paragraph*.

**Example Output (Illustrative):**

John Smith is a formal individual in a position of authority. He is a decision-maker or key stakeholder in a professional environment and is perceived as busy or prefers concise communication.

**Important Considerations:**

*   **Indirect Inference:** This is based on *indirect inference* from how others communicate with the user.
*   **Context is Key:** The context (business, personal, etc.) is crucial.
*   **Limitations:** This provides a *possible* sketch based on limited information.
* **Bias:** Avoid assumptions. Base inferences on observed patterns.
* **Alternative Explanations:** Consider alternative explanations.
