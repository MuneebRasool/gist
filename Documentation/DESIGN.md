## 1. The Big Picture üéØ

GIST isn't just a task manager - it's your digital brain extension! We've built a system that doesn't just manage tasks; it understands them, prioritizes them, and serves them to you exactly when you need them.

### ‚ú® What Makes GIST Special?
- ü§ñ **Smart Task Extraction**: We don't just collect tasks; we discover them from your digital footprint
- üß† **Context-Aware Prioritization**: Your tasks are prioritized based on who you are, not just what they are
- üìö **Learning & Adaptation**: The more you use it, the smarter it gets
- üèóÔ∏è **Built for Scale**: From solo professionals to enterprise teams, we've got you covered

### üî¨ The Science Behind the Magic

### Core System Goals
1. **Dynamic Information Surfacing**: Surface relevant and actionable information while minimizing cognitive load
2. **Multi-Agent Coordination**: Orchestrate specialized agents that perform tasks and analyses on behalf of the user

### Core Principles

1. **Information as a Graph**
   - Maintain a weighted, real-time graph G(t) instead of static hierarchies
   - Nodes represent tasks, information, and agents
   - Edges capture relationships and dependencies
   - Weights reflect current relevance and strength of connections

2. **Dynamic Relevance Scoring**
   - For each node i at time t, calculate relevance score:
     ```math
     R_i(t) = Œ±¬∑U_i(t) - Œ≤¬∑C_i(t)
     ```
   - Where:
     - R_i(t): Overall relevance score
     - U_i(t): Utility factor (importance/urgency)
     - C_i(t): Cognitive cost factor
     - Œ±, Œ≤: Learning-adjusted scaling parameters

3. **Temporal Adaptation**
   - Continuously adjust relevance scores based on:
     - Current context
     - User feedback
     - Time-based decay
   - Update edge weights to reflect changing relationships

4. **Task Dependency Management**
   - Represent task dependencies as a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG)
   - Capture prerequisites and constraints
   - Enable optimal task sequencing

5. **Multi-Agent Coordination**
   - Distribute tasks to specialized agents using confidence scoring:
     ```math
     P(A_k|T_i^r)
     ```
   - Where:
     - A_k: Agent k
     - T_i^r: Task i with requirements r
     - P(): Probability of successful completion

6. **User-Centric Feedback Loop**
   - Learn from user actions and overrides
   - Continuously update system weights and parameters
   - Adapt to user preferences and patterns

### Task Model

Each task T_i in the system is modeled as an entity with:

1. **Dynamic Relevance**: R_i(t) that evolves with time
2. **Dependencies**: D(T_i, T_j) capturing task relationships
3. **Activation Threshold**: A_i determining when a task becomes actionable

The core relevance formula:

```math
R_i(t) = Œ±¬∑U_i(t) - Œ≤¬∑C_i(t)
```

Where:
- U_i(t): Utility factor - measures importance and urgency
- C_i(t): Cognitive cost - estimates required mental effort
- Œ±, Œ≤: System-learned scaling factors that adapt to user behavior

Here's where it gets exciting! We've turned task management into a mathematical art form. Imagine each task in your life as a point in a complex network, constantly moving and evolving. Here's how we model it:

Let's say you have tasks T‚ÇÅ, T‚ÇÇ, ..., T‚Çô floating in your digital universe. Each task T·µ¢ isn't just a to-do item; it's a living entity with:

1. üìà A dynamic relevance score R·µ¢(t) that breathes with time
2. üîó A smart dependency system D(T·µ¢, T‚±º) that knows what needs to happen first
3. ‚ö° An activation threshold A·µ¢ that determines when a task becomes actionable

The real magic happens in our relevance formula:

```math
R·µ¢(t) = Œ±¬∑U·µ¢(t) - Œ≤¬∑C·µ¢(t)
```

Where:
- üìä U·µ¢(t): The utility factor (how important/urgent is it?)
- üí™ C·µ¢(t): The cognitive cost (how much mental energy will it take?)
- üéØ Œ±, Œ≤: Our smart scaling factors that learn from your behavior
